This is a project that I did for academic purpose. It is a three tier web application for an e-book store. It follows the Model View Controller (MVC) framework. It has a basic fronend UI. Javascript logic has been used for validation. It is connected to a simple database for login and signup purposes.JSP and servlet technologies have been used for the database connectivity.
