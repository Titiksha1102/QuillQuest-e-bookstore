This is a three tier web application for an e-book store. It follows the Model View Controller (MVC) framework. It has a basic fronend UI. Javascript logic has been used for validation. It is connected to a simple MySQL database for login and signup purposes.
The backend of the app has two versions:
One uses JSP and Java servlet(checkout branch: java-version)
The other uses PHP.(checkout branch: main & branch2)

The cart functionality isn't complete. I'am working on it.
