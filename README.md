This is a three tier web application for an e-book store. It follows the Model View Controller (MVC) framework. It has a basic fronend UI. Javascript logic has been used for validation. It is connected to a simple database for login and signup purposes.JSP , Java servlet and php technologies have been used for the database connectivity.

The cart functionality isn't complete. I'am working on it.
